## 📘 Basic Calculator Program

This is a simple Python command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes two numeric inputs from the user and asks for the desired operation to perform.

---

### 🚀 Features

* Supports the four basic arithmetic operations:

  * Addition (`+`)
  * Subtraction (`-`)
  * Multiplication (`*`)
  * Division (`/`)
* Handles division by zero errors gracefully.
* Easy to use via the command line.

### 🛠️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have **Python installed** on your machine (version 3.x recommended).
2. Save the code in a file named, for example, `calculator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where your file is saved.
5. Run the program with the command:

### 💡 Example Usage

```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *  
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0  
```

### ⚠️ Error Handling

* If the user tries to divide by zero, the program will display:
  `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`
* If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will display:
  `Invalid operation. Please enter +, -, *, or /.`
